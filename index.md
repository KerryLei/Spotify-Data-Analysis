You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/swebster2/Spotify-Data-Analysis/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Code

```{}
setwd("/Users/1d_lyx/Desktop/Rdataset/")
songDF <- read.csv("featuresdf.csv")
songDF2 <- read.csv("data.csv")
songDF2$key <- as.factor(songDF2$key)
songDF2$mode <- as.factor(songDF2$mode)
songDF2$time_signature <- as.factor(songDF2$time_signature)
songDF2$target <- as.factor(songDF2$target)
```

```{}
songDF$mode <- as.factor(songDF$mode)
summary(songDF[,-c(1,2)]) #min, max, and mean
round(sapply(songDF[,-c(1,2)], sd), 4) #standard deviation
```
We delete the first two rows because they are id and names, which does not make sense in this analysis.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/swebster2/Spotify-Data-Analysis/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
